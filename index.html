			<td>The top header gives the visitors choices to scope through either their work, services or letting you know how to contact them, amongst others. On the "Work" page, they present three projects in bigger frames at the top, with project titles in bright colors over the images informing the visitor what this is. If you scroll down, earlier projects are presented in smaller frames, with easy readable "footers" at the bottom. At the "Contact" pages, you can choose which office you wish to contact, sorted geographically. </td>

			<td>On their home page, Frog Design uses automatic photo slideshow of ongoing bigger projects as well as news relevant to their business, where the visitor may click forward or backward. They do not use any colorchancing or highlightning for indication that you may enter the different pages, but the mousepointer changes to a link pointer as it hovers over hyperlinks or hyperimages. ightbox and if so how elegantly? Do they allow sorting, categorizing (again this is like navigation).</td>

However, when entering the Europe and Asia-pages, these pages looks quite unfinished. The USA pages, however, are more finished. Usage of black and yeallow details may perhaps be an effort to appeal to the industry business. This may not help, as he overall image of the company fades, as the visitor most likely visited the Asia and Europe section first, if the visitor has navigated through the links in reading direction. They can't keep up visually with the very first home page</td>

			<td>Teams Design's user friendliness of the pages under the sectiongs "Europe" and "Asia" are fairly poor, giving the visitor a bad impression. The structure is chaotic and with too little air between boxes. This makes it more frustrating to figure what's what and where to go, and it looks is in general esthetically not appealing. At the USA-homepage, however, they have done a little more effort. As my guess is that this is the main pages as this point of the page development, I will mainly use the USA-pages for the comparison. At the top, you may choose between "teams in action", "news", "contact" or "careers". At the same time, on the left side, you may find "brands", "categories", "case studies", "specialties" and "about us". These two menus are conflicting, and confuses the visitor. If I would like to investigate more of their work, I would not be immediately sure where to go. This makes it an confusing and inefficient page. If I were to contact this firm, I would also be a bit unsure if "contact" would be for the american office, or if I would be directed to an international office.  </td>

Something that makes this site less efficient though, is that there is no information concerning the projects visible unless you hold the mouse pointer over them.

By the introductional text on the front page, you quickly figure out what he does, but it is harder to dig deeper in his different projects.
