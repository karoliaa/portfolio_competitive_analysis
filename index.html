			<td>Five boxes. Below, we see a implementation of the five box layout. The primary graphic rotates and displays news relevant to Frog's interest area. Clicking on one of the boxes will bring the visitor to the dedicated page where you can find out more information.Simple, effective and attractive.

			<td>Frog Design's web page gives the visitors an impression that they are playful and fresh-thinking, but a serious business as well. Their web sites are clean and tidy, with big fonts and big pictures. </td>

			<td>Functionality:</td>
			<td>The top header gives the visitors choices to scope through either their work, services or letting you know how to contact them, amongst others. On the "Work" page, they present three projects in bigger frames at the top, with project titles in bright colors over the images informing the visitor what this is. If you scroll down, earlier projects are presented in smaller frames, with easy readable "footers" at the bottom. At the "Contact" pages, you can choose which office you wish to contact, sorted geographically. </td>

		<tr>
			<td>Interactivity:</td>
			<td>On their home page, Frog Design uses automatic photo slideshow of ongoing bigger projects as well as news relevant to their business, where the visitor may click forward or backward. They do not use any colorchancing or highlightning for indication that you may enter the different pages, but the mousepointer changes to a link pointer as it hovers over hyperlinks or hyperimages. ightbox and if so how elegantly? Do they allow sorting, categorizing (again this is like navigation).</td>

If you click on either of the cities presented under "Contact", the tab is highlighted, indicating that you are to be found on the chosen city. </td>
